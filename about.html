                <p>
                    Chai Tales was born from India’s timeless love for tea. ☕✨<br><br>
While tea first arrived in India through ancient trade routes and blossomed during the British era, Chai Tales brings this rich heritage to life with a modern twist. Our journey began to celebrate the soulful stories brewed in every cup, creating a space where tradition meets taste — and every sip tells a tale. 🌿❤️<br><br>
